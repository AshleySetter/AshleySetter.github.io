# ajs3g11.github.io
Website repo

I have set this up using pelican-quickstart and set it up to use github pages. typing make github in the same directory as the makefile will cause it to make the output files and push the changes to my github, these changed will be reflected in the site "http://ajs3g11.github.io" after a few seconds (~20 or so).
